```cpp
  int i = 1;
  int const volatile *p1 = &i;
  int volatile *const p2 = &i;
  int const *volatile p3 = &i;
  int *const volatile p4 = &i;
```
### **Pointer Declarations Breakdown**

#### **1. `int const volatile *p1 = &i;`**

- **Right-to-left reading:**  
  `p1` is a pointer (`*`) to `int const volatile`.
- **Meaning:**  
  `p1` points to an `int` that is both `const` (cannot be modified) and `volatile` (may change unpredictably, e.g., hardware-driven changes).
- **Key Point:**  
  The pointer itself (`p1`) is not `const`, meaning it can point to other data later. However, the data pointed to by `p1` is `const` and `volatile`.

---

#### **2. `int volatile *const p2 = &i;`**

- **Right-to-left reading:**  
  `p2` is a constant (`const`) pointer to `int volatile`.
- **Meaning:**
    - The pointer itself is `const`, so `p2` cannot point to any other variable after initialization.
    - However, the `int` being pointed to is `volatile`, meaning its value might change unexpectedly.
- **Key Point:**  
  You can modify the data pointed to (if not restricted by other qualifiers), but you cannot change the address stored in `p2`.

---

#### **3. `int const *volatile p3 = &i;`**

- **Right-to-left reading:**  
  `p3` is a volatile pointer to `int const`.
- **Meaning:**
    - The pointer itself (`p3`) is `volatile`, meaning its value (the address it holds) might change unexpectedly.
    - The `int` being pointed to is `const`, meaning you cannot modify the value of the `int` through `p3`.
- **Key Point:**  
  The `p3` pointer might change to point to different locations, but you cannot modify the data it points to.

---

#### **4. `int *const volatile p4 = &i;`**

- **Right-to-left reading:**  
  `p4` is a volatile constant (`const`) pointer to `int`.
- **Meaning:**
    - The pointer is both `const` and `volatile`. It cannot point to any other variable (`const`), and its value (the address it holds) might change unexpectedly (`volatile`).
    - The `int` being pointed to has no qualifiers, so it can be freely modified.
- **Key Point:**  
  The address stored in `p4` is fixed (`const`), but `p4` might still change due to external reasons (`volatile`).

### **Summary of Each Declaration**

| Declaration                    | Pointer Qualifiers           | Pointed-to Data Qualifiers | Key Characteristics                                    |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `int const volatile *p1`       | None                         | `const volatile`           | Pointer can change, data cannot be modified but may change unpredictably. |
| `int volatile *const p2`       | `const`                      | `volatile`                 | Pointer cannot change, but the data can be modified and may change unpredictably. |
| `int const *volatile p3`       | `volatile`                   | `const`                    | Pointer can change unpredictably, but the data cannot be modified.          |
| `int *const volatile p4`       | `const volatile`             | None                       | Pointer cannot change, but its value may change unpredictably; data can be modified. |

### **Visualizing Their Behavior**

Letâ€™s assume:
```cpp
int i = 1;       // Modifiable integer
int j = 2;       // Another modifiable integer
```

1. **`p1` can point to another variable but cannot modify the pointed-to data.**
   ```cpp
   p1 = &j;  // Valid: Changing what `p1` points to.
   *p1 = 3;  // Invalid: Data is `const`.
   ```

2. **`p2` cannot point to another variable but can modify the data it points to.**
   ```cpp
   p2 = &j;  // Invalid: Pointer is `const`.
   *p2 = 4;  // Valid: Data is modifiable.
   ```

3. **`p3` can point to another variable but cannot modify the data it points to.**
   ```cpp
   p3 = &j;  // Valid: Changing what `p3` points to.
   *p3 = 5;  // Invalid: Data is `const`.
   ```

4. **`p4` cannot point to another variable but can modify the data it points to.**
   ```cpp
   p4 = &j;  // Invalid: Pointer is `const`.
   *p4 = 6;  // Valid: Data is modifiable.
   ```

### **Takeaway**

This example demonstrates how the qualifiers (`const`, `volatile`) apply either to the **pointer** or to the **pointed-to data**. By carefully analyzing declarations from right to left, you can understand the restrictions imposed by qualifiers on both the pointer and the data it manages.
