### **What are Declarators and Qualifiers?**

- **Declarators**: Symbols like `*` (pointer) and `&` (reference) that indicate the variable type in C++.
    - Example: `int* ptr` means `ptr` is a pointer to an integer.
    - Example: `int& ref` means `ref` is a reference to an integer.

- **Qualifiers**: Keywords like `const` and `volatile` that describe extra rules about the type, like immutability.
    - Example: `const int x` means `x` is an immutable integer.

---

### **What is "Highest-Level"?**

When a type has multiple declarators and qualifiers, **highest-level** means:
- **Declarator**: The symbol (`*` or `&`) closest to the variable name.
- **Qualifier**: The qualifier (`const` or `volatile`) that applies directly to the variable.

---

### **Understanding Declarators**

Declarators like `*` (pointer) and `&` (reference) can combine in complex ways. The **highest-level declarator** is the one that directly applies to the variable.

#### Example 1: Simple Pointer
```cpp
int* ptr;
```
- Declarator: `*` (pointer).
- `ptr` is a pointer to an integer.

#### Example 2: Pointer to Pointer
```cpp
int** ptr;
```
- Declarator: The **highest-level** declarator is the first `*` because it applies directly to `ptr`.
- `ptr` is a pointer to another pointer to an integer.

#### Example 3: Reference
```cpp
int* const& ref;
```
- Start reading from the variable `ref`:
    - `&`: `ref` is a reference.
    - `const`: To a constant pointer.
    - `*`: That points to an integer.

So:
- **Highest-level declarator**: `&` (reference).
- `ref` is a reference to a constant pointer to an integer.

### **Understanding Qualifiers**

Qualifiers like `const` and `volatile` can apply at **different levels** in a type:
- **Highest-level qualifiers**: Apply directly to the variable (like the pointer itself).
- **Lower-level qualifiers**: Apply to the underlying type (like the data being pointed to).

#### Example 1: Constant Pointer
```cpp
int* const ptr;
```
- `ptr` is a constant pointer to an integer.
- **Highest-level qualifier**: `const` (applies to the pointer).
- You cannot modify the pointer itself, but you can modify the integer it points to.

#### Example 2: Pointer to Constant
```cpp
const int* ptr;
```
- `ptr` is a pointer to a constant integer.
- **Highest-level qualifier**: None (pointer itself is not constant).
- **Lower-level qualifier**: `const` (applies to the integer being pointed to).

#### Example 3: Constant Pointer to Constant
```cpp
const int* const ptr;
```
- `ptr` is a constant pointer to a constant integer.
- **Highest-level qualifier**: `const` (applies to the pointer).
- **Lower-level qualifier**: `const` (applies to the integer being pointed to).

---

### **Why Do "Highest-Level" Declarators and Qualifiers Matter?**

They determine:
1. **What you can modify** in your code:
    - A **`const` pointer** cannot change its address.
    - A pointer to a **`const` value** cannot modify the value it points to.

2. **How you interpret complex type definitions**:
    - Example: `int* const&` means:
        - A reference to a constant pointer to an integer.

### **Practice with Examples**

#### Example 1: Highest-Level Declarator
```cpp
int* const ptr;
```
- **Highest-level declarator**: `*` (pointer).
- `ptr` is a constant pointer to an integer.

#### Example 2: Highest-Level Qualifier
```cpp
const int* ptr;
```
- **Highest-level qualifier**: None (pointer itself is not constant).
- **Lower-level qualifier**: `const` (integer is constant).

#### Example 3: Combined Declarators and Qualifiers
```cpp
int* const& ref;
```
- Start from `ref` (the variable name):
    - `&`: `ref` is a reference.
    - `const`: To a constant pointer.
    - `*`: That points to an integer.

- `ref` is a reference to a constant pointer to an integer.

---

### **Key Rules to Remember**
1. **Declarators (`*`, `&`)**:
    - The closest declarator to the variable name is the **highest-level declarator**.
    - Example: `int* const& ref` → Highest-level declarator is `&`.

2. **Qualifiers (`const`, `volatile`)**:
    - The qualifier directly applied to the variable is the **highest-level qualifier**.
    - Example: `int* const ptr` → Highest-level qualifier is `const` (applies to the pointer).
