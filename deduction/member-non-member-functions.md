In C++, a **non-member function** is a function that is defined **outside of a class**. It is not associated with any specific class as a member. These functions operate independently and are not tied to a class's instance or scope.

### Characteristics of Non-Member Functions:
1. **Defined Outside a Class**:
    - Unlike member functions, non-member functions are not part of a class's scope.
    - They are typically declared at the global scope or within a namespace.

2. **Do Not Have Access to Private or Protected Members**:
    - Non-member functions cannot directly access private or protected members of a class unless they are declared as **friend** functions.

3. **Can Be Used Without an Object**:
    - Non-member functions do not require an object instance to be called.

4. **Independent of Class State**:
    - They do not maintain or rely on the internal state of a class.

### Example of a Non-Member Function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Non-member function
void printMessage() {
    cout << "This is a non-member function." << endl;
}

int main() {
    printMessage(); // Call to the non-member function
    return 0;
}
```

### Non-Member vs. Member Functions

| **Feature**                | **Non-Member Function**              | **Member Function**                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**             | Outside of a class                  | Inside a class                          |
| **Requires an Object**     | No                                  | Yes (except for `static` member functions) |
| **Access to Private Data** | No (unless declared `friend`)       | Yes                                     |
| **Scope**                  | Global or namespace scope           | Class scope                             |

### Friend Functions as Non-Members:
A **friend function** is a special kind of non-member function that is allowed to access the private and protected members of a class.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int secretValue = 42;

public:
    // Declare a non-member function as a friend
    friend void revealSecret(const MyClass &obj);
};

// Non-member function that is a friend
void revealSecret(const MyClass &obj) {
    cout << "The secret value is: " << obj.secretValue << endl;
}

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    revealSecret(obj); // Access private data through a friend
    return 0;
}
```

### Use Cases for Non-Member Functions:
1. **Utility Functions**:
    - General-purpose functions that do not depend on a class's state, such as mathematical operations or logging utilities.

2. **Overloading Operators**:
    - Some operators can be implemented as non-member functions (e.g., `operator<<` for `std::ostream`).

3. **Encapsulation of Global Logic**:
    - Functions that are logically separate from any specific class can be implemented as non-member functions.

### In Context of Templates:
The document mentions **non-member function templates**, which are templates defined outside of a class. These templates can work with any data type passed to them, providing flexibility and reusability.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Non-member function template
template <typename T>
void display(T value) {
    cout << "Value: " << value << endl;
}

int main() {
    display(42);          // Works with int
    display(3.14);        // Works with double
    display("Hello!");    // Works with const char*
    return 0;
}
```
